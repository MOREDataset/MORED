# MORED
a MORoccan buildingsâ€™ Electricity consumption Dataset

MORED is the first public dataset of Moroccan buildings' electricity consumption.  It contains labelled WP and IL ground-truth consumption data acquired at 1/5[S/s] rates, labelled IL signatures acquired at 50k[S/s] and 4[S/s], and WP consumption data acquired at 1/5[S/s] or 1/10[S/s] rates. The aim for providing such a dataset is to continue the progress that the field of energy disaggregation knew in the previous decade, by providing a dataset that has more data and utilises the field's recent advances.
